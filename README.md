ðŸ‘‹ Hello World! I'm @BayaniRoxas, a tech enthusiast with a love for coding and problem-solving.

ðŸš€ I hope to specialize in front-end web development, and I'm always eager to learn and explore new technologies. 
My journey in the world of coding began after watching Iron Man, and I've been hooked ever since.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning: Python, JavaScript (React) for my programming languages. And of course HTML and CSS (Markup)

Happy coding! ðŸš€
